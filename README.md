# The Workshop ü¶æüåêüìüÔ∏è‚ú®
>A repo to experiment with various cool languages, technologies and whatever else I can think of

## Naming Conventions
### Subdirectories
- Each subdir is a place for experiments
- They each start with the technology's name, then a word to imply what the directory's for
- Usually, that's a word for a place where stuff gets designed, built or tested
  - Actions instead of places work too

### Readmes
- Named with puns, that's about all there is to say

## Licensing üîèüìÑ
- See [`LICENCE`](./LICENSE)
  - Additional licenses can be found in [`extra/`](./extra/)

### Addendums
#### Subdirectories
The license present in [`LICENCE`](./LICENSE) applies to this entire repository, excluding subdirectories which contain their own license file (either directly, or via shortcut). In such cases, the license file in the subdirectory takes precedence.

#### Additional License Files
Licenses in [`./extra/`](./extra/) do not apply to anything, unless referred to by [`LICENSE`](./LICENSE)
