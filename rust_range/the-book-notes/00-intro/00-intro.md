# The Book
## My Notes
- keep terse, makes notes easier to review
- links where helpful

## Foreword
- rust is about empowerment

## Introduction
- low-level control *with* high-level ergonomics

### Who's Rust For?
#### Dev Teams
- compiler is a gatekeeper, doesn't compile w/ bugs
- `cargo` brings dependency management to the systems programming world
- `rustfmt` brings a consistent style across devs
- `rust-analyzer` juices up IDEs
- `clippy` is the linting tool

#### Students
- welcoming community
- systems programming accessibility

#### Companies
- used in a lot of stuff
- [Wikipedia Rust Adoption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rust_(programming_language)#Adoption)

#### Open Src Devs
- for those who wanna

#### People who want speed / stability
- speed of a running rust program
- speed at which you can write rust programs
- zero-cost abstractions, higher-level features

## Who's This Book For?
- assumes you've coded in another programming language (any lang)
